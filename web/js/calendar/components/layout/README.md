## Function Overlap Analysis

### Duplicate Functions
- **`hashString(str)`** - Identical implementation in `index.js` LayoutUtils, should be extracted to shared utility.
- **`groupOverlappingEvents(events)`** - Similar functionality in both `OverlapDetector.js` and `GridLayoutEngine.js` with different implementations.
- **`calculateResponsiveBreakpoints(containerWidth)`** - Similar functionality in both `index.js` LayoutUtils and `GridLayoutEngine.js` with different implementations.

### Similar Functions
- **Cache key generation** - `index.js` LayoutUtils.generateLayoutKey vs `GridLayoutEngine.js` cacheLayout/getCachedLayout - different approaches to caching.
- **Layout calculation** - Multiple components have layout calculation methods with different purposes and implementations.
- **Breakpoint management** - `ResponsiveLayout.js` has comprehensive breakpoint management while `GridLayoutEngine.js` has simplified version.

### Unique Functions
- **Overlap detection algorithms** - `OverlapDetector.js` has sophisticated overlap detection and metrics calculation.
- **Responsive design management** - `ResponsiveLayout.js` has comprehensive responsive design with event listeners and breakpoint management.
- **Grid layout calculations** - `GridLayoutEngine.js` has specific time-based layout calculations for week and month views.
- **Factory pattern and convenience methods** - `index.js` provides the factory function and delegation methods.

### Missing Integration Points
- **Overlap detection coordination** - `GridLayoutEngine.js` has its own simple overlap grouping while `OverlapDetector.js` provides more sophisticated detection.
- **Responsive breakpoint coordination** - Multiple components calculate responsive breakpoints independently.
- **Cache coordination** - Different caching strategies across components without integration.
