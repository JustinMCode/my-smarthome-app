Locations: All view files
Lines saved if consolidated: 25
Suggested solution: Create ContainerValidator utility

### Functionality: Event listener cleanup
Locations: week-view.js
Lines saved if consolidated: 20

function validateContainer(container, viewName) {
    if (!container) {
        throw new Error(`${viewName} container not found`);
    }
    return container;
}

// Event listener management utility
class EventManager {
    constructor() {
        this.listeners = new Map();
    }
    
    add(element, event, handler, options = {}) {
        element.addEventListener(event, handler, options);
        this.listeners.set(`${element.id}-${event}`, { element, event, handler });
    }
    
    removeAll() {
        this.listeners.forEach(({ element, event, handler }) => {
            element.removeEventListener(event, handler);
        });
        this.listeners.clear();
    }
}

// Date formatting utility
class DateFormatter {
    static format(date, format = 'short') {

    }
    
    static formatTime(date) {
        // Centralized time formatting logic
    }
}
```

## Performance Optimization Opportunities

### 1. Virtual Scrolling
- **Issue**: Large event lists render all items at once
- **Impact**: Poor performance with 100+ events
- **Solution**: Implement virtual scrolling for week view

### 2. Event Delegation
- **Issue**: Individual event listeners for each element
- **Impact**: Memory usage and performance degradation
- **Solution**: Use event delegation for similar interactions

### 3. Lazy Loading
- **Issue**: All view components loaded at initialization
- **Impact**: Slower initial load time
- **Solution**: Implement lazy loading for view components

### 4. DOM Fragment Usage
- **Issue**: Multiple DOM manipulations during rendering
- **Impact**: Layout thrashing and poor performance
- **Solution**: Use DocumentFragment for batch DOM operations

## Security Considerations

### 1. XSS Prevention
- **Issue**: Direct innerHTML usage without sanitization
- **Impact**: Potential XSS vulnerabilities
- **Solution**: Use textContent or sanitize HTML input

### 2. Input Validation
- **Issue**: Missing validation for user inputs
- **Impact**: Potential injection attacks
- **Solution**: Add comprehensive input validation

### 3. Event Handler Security
- **Issue**: Inline event handlers with user data
- **Impact**: Potential code injection
- **Solution**: Use proper event delegation and sanitization

## Testing Strategy

### 1. Unit Tests
- Test individual view components in isolation
- Mock dependencies for focused testing
- Test error conditions and edge cases

### 2. Integration Tests
- Test view interactions with calendar core
- Test view switching and state management
- Test event handling across views

### 3. Performance Tests
- Test rendering performance with large datasets
- Test memory usage and leak detection
- Test mobile performance and touch interactions

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
1. Create utility classes (EventManager, LoadingState, etc.)
2. Extract common patterns to shared utilities
3. Add comprehensive error handling

### Phase 2: Modularization (Week 3-6)
1. Split large view files into focused modules
2. Implement proper separation of concerns
3. Add comprehensive documentation

### Phase 3: Performance (Week 7-8)
